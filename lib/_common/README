Provides common functionality used among many FNNDSC projects.

The __init__.py will always import the 'systemMisc.py' module. It will
"try" to import the nibabel extensions as well. However, not all systems
will have nibabel installed. In such cases, the extensions are ignored
and only the 'systemMisc.py' is imported.
